# Read a list of integers:
a = [int(s) for s in input().split()]  #this line is from repl.it
for i in range(1, len(a)): #range is (min_value, max_value)
    if a[i] > a[i-1]:  #look through and if the item is greater than item to left, print
        print(a[i], end=' ') #this prints all on one line
