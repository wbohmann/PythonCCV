#3 Write and test a function for the following:
#squareEach(nums) - nums is a list of numbers. Modifies the list by squaring each entry.
 #nums is an argument that will loop through the list.  
 
def squareEach(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)): 
        nums[i] = nums[i]**2
#the number of numbers is not determined but the len(nums) will find the length of numbers 
#and then set each element to it's square
        
       
def main():
    num_list = [2,4,5,9] #a list of integers
    print("Your numbers are: ", (num_list))
    squareEach(num_list) #test the squareEach function with the number list
    print("Your squared numbers are: ", num_list)
    

main()
