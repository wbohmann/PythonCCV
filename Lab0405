#Name Swithcing:  
Ask the user to enter a person's name in first-last order, and display the name in last-comma-first order. For example, if the user enters the string "Thomas Jefferson" #, the output should be "Jefferson, Thomas". Allow the user to input 3 names.  Call the program  nameReverse.

def nameReverse():
    for x in range(3):
        name =input("How about a proper name: ")
        words = name.split()  #this will return a list
        print(words[1] + ", " + words[0])
        
nameReverse()

#Splitting a domain name
#Ask the user to enter a three-part internet domain name and print the company name only. For example, if the user enters the string "www.Amazon.com", the output should #be "Amazon". Call the program companyName. Allow the user to input 3 internet domain names.

def companyName():
    for x in range(3):
        name =input("Enter a three part internet domain name, like www.Amazon.com: ")
        print(name[4:-4]) #in the range www. is the first four and -4 is last four

#Slice and Dice
#Write a program, initials, to ask the user to enter the names of the students in a class. The program should first ask how many names will be input. Then it should ask #for the first name and last name of student 1, the name of student 2, the name of student 3, etc. For each student, it should determine the studentâ€™s initials and #output these initials.

def initials():
    num_range = int(input("How many names would you like to input?"))
    for x in range(num_range):
        f_name = input("Enter the first name of student: ")
        l_name = input("Enter the last name of student: ")
        print("The student's initials are "+ (f_name[0])+(l_name[0]))
